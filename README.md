# Fitness App (MVP v2)

Adds **program split templates** and **auto-generated Weeks & Days**.

## New
- Choose split when creating a Program:
  - **Bro Split** (Chest/Back/Shoulders/Arms/Legs)
  - **PPL** (Push/Pull/Legs)
  - **ULPPL** (Upper/Lower/Push/Pull/Legs)
  - **Custom** (no days pre-added)
- Enter **# of weeks** (default 4). The app creates `Week 1..N` and populates Days per chosen split for each week.
- Programs tab shows a **nested view**: Weeks with their Days listed inside.

Other v1 features remain: logging sets, last-weight suggestion, rest timer, PWA/offline, export/import.

## Deploy
Upload these files to a repo root and enable GitHub Pages (Deploy from branch → main → /(root)).
